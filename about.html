	<h2>Me</h2>
	<p>I am a second year(level 5) Computer networking, Sercurity and Forensics student at Edge Hill University. In my first year I completed 6 including one for Web development and another for Programming. I regularly practice programming, meaning my abilty to write code has dramatically improved. My reason for making this website is to display my html, css and javascript skills, as well as to show my portfolio for java and python programs.</p>
	<h3>Programming</h3>
	<p>I began programming just over two <!--Will need to be changed every so often-->years ago in which I have developed skills in Java, Python, html, css and javascript. I regularly do codecademy tutorials to boost my skill and also try to go through as many tutorials as i can.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I also have the ability to program databases using SQL, and can use the command line with linux based systems and windows. i can also use the commands for git hub so I can contribute and help large projects.</p>
